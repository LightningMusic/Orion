# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

Project Orion is a zero-touch infrastructure provisioning platform designed to automate the conversion of surplus and commodity computer hardware into managed virtualization infrastructure.

The project exists to eliminate repetitive deployment work while maintaining strict operator oversight for irreversible operations such as storage sanitization.

This document serves as the authoritative engineering specification for the Orion project.

No production feature shall be implemented before its behavior has been documented within this Software Requirements Specification.

---

## 1.2 Background

Building and maintaining virtualization clusters often requires repetitive manual configuration of hardware, firmware, operating systems, networking, and virtualization software.

Many organizations—and home lab operators—acquire large quantities of retired laptops and desktop systems that still possess significant computational value.

Preparing these systems manually is slow, error-prone, inconsistent, and difficult to reproduce.

Project Orion was conceived to standardize this process through automation while preserving operator control over destructive actions.

---

## 1.3 Project Mission

Project Orion exists to provide a safe, repeatable, operator-supervised provisioning platform for converting commodity computer hardware into managed Proxmox cluster resources.

The system shall minimize technician effort while maximizing deployment consistency, operational safety, and long-term maintainability.

---

# 2. Project Overview

Project Orion is not an operating system.

Project Orion is not a replacement for Proxmox.

Project Orion is an automated deployment platform responsible for preparing hardware for use within a Proxmox virtualization cluster.

The project provides tooling for:

* Hardware inspection
* Hardware validation
* Optional data recovery
* Secure storage preparation
* Automated Proxmox installation
* First-boot configuration
* Cluster enrollment
* Inventory registration
* Hardware benchmarking
* Deployment reporting

The deployment environment is distributed using bootable USB media.

The USB serves only as the deployment medium.

The Orion source code, documentation, build system, release process, and version control are maintained independently within the project's source repository.

---

# 3. Vision

The long-term vision of Project Orion is to allow a technician to transform supported computer hardware into production-ready virtualization resources using a standardized, repeatable deployment workflow.

When complete, Orion shall require minimal technician interaction after deployment has been authorized.

The deployment experience should resemble enterprise device provisioning platforms while remaining fully self-hosted and optimized for Proxmox environments.

The system shall scale from individual laboratory deployments to clusters consisting of many nodes without requiring architectural redesign.

---
