# Project Orion Development Roadmap (Version 2.0)

**Project:** Project Orion

**Status:** Active Development

**Roadmap Version:** 2.0

# Development Standards

Every implementation shall:

* Trace to an SRS requirement.
* Follow the established architecture.
* Use the Orion logging framework.
* Use the Orion configuration framework.
* Register services through the Service Container.
* Communicate through the Event Bus where appropriate.
* Include error handling.
* Include documentation.
* Include tests where practical.
* Be reviewed before merging.

---

# Git Workflow

Feature branches:

* `feature/<feature-name>`
* `bugfix/<bug-name>`
* `docs/<document-name>`
* `refactor/<component-name>`

Commit prefixes:

* `feat:`
* `fix:`
* `docs:`
* `refactor:`
* `test:`
* `build:`
* `ci:`

---

# Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:

* SRS requirement implemented.
* Code builds successfully.
* Tests pass.
* Documentation updated.
* Logging implemented.
* Configuration supported.
* Errors handled gracefully.
* Code committed.
* Code reviewed.
* Merged into `main`.

---

# Long-Term Vision

Project Orion is intended to become a modular, enterprise-quality deployment platform capable of transforming retired hardware into managed Proxmox infrastructure with minimal operator effort.

The guiding principle remains:

> **Automate everything that is safe to automate. Require human judgment only for irreversible decisions.**
